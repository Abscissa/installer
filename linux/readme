"dmd_deb.sh"
============
Script to create deb packages for debian like systems.
Just run it with the version argument and You'll get a deb for that version in the same folder of the script.
If running on a 32 bit system, you will get a 32 bits package, if in 64 bit system, a 64 bit package.
Resulting package should be installable on any debian like system (tested on debian, ubuntu and linuxmint).
If "dmd.x.xxx.zip" already exist in the script folder, will be used, if not, will try to download first.
If "d-completion.sh" file is in the script folder, will be included in the package.
Works only with dmd 1.068/2.055 and newer.



"dmd_rpm.sh"
============
Script to create rpm packages (only fedora and openSUSE supported).
Just run it with the version argument and You'll get an rpm for that version in the same folder of the script.
If running on a 32 bit system, you will get a 32 bits package, if in 64 bit system, a 64 bit package.
If running on fedora, you'll get a fedora specific rpm package.
  (rmp like systems do not share the same nomenclature for the package names)
  (In other words, one rpm package for fedora can become not installable in openSUSE due to dependencies)
If "dmd.x.xxx.zip" already exist in the script folder, will be used, if not, will try to download first.
If "d-completion.sh" file is in the script folder, will be included in the package.
Works only with dmd 1.068/2.055 and newer.
